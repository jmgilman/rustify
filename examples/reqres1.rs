// While using a builder archetype for requests is not required, it's often the
// cleanest way for building requests. For this endpoint it doesn't bring too
// much benefit, however, for consistency it's implemented anyways.
//
// Setting the `builder` attribute to true adds a `builder()` method to the
// struct for easily getting a default instance of the request builder.
//
// Rustify supports a few more parameters in the endpoint definition than are
// shown here. It resorts to sane defaults in most cases. For our example they
// are as follows:
// * method: defaults to GET
// * request_type: defaults to JSON
// * response_type: defaults to JSON

// Some responses from the API are paginated and contain a common wrapper around
// the actual resulting data. Since this is so prevalent in APIs, rustify offers

// Below we define the details of the wrapper that appears around paginated
// responses. The form of the resulting data field is specified with a generic
// and will be supplied when we call the endpoint. Endpoints have a special
// `exec_wrap()` method which will automatically wrap the response from the
// endpoint in the given wrapper.
