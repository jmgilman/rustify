## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.4] - 2024-04-02

### Changed

- Bump request to 0.12

## [0.5.3] - 2022-03-15

### Fixed

- Made `rustls-tls` feature gated to maintain MIT license
- Made logging less verbose by using `debug` over `info`
- Updated dependencies

## [0.5.2] - 2021-09-29

### Fixed

- Adds support for copying struct-level serde attributes

## [0.5.1] - 2021-09-28

### Fixed

- Fixes a bug where response headers were not being properly returned

## [0.5.0] - 2021-09-27

### Changed

- Breaking: Raw data tag changed from `#[data]` to `#[raw]`
- Breaking: `skip_serializing_none` functionality integrated into the macro and
  will now conflict if the attribute is present.
- Breaking: `#[serde(skip)]` must be replaced with `#[endpoint(skip)]`
- Breaking: All `exec_*` functions have been removed. Using `MiddleWare` is now
  done by calling `.with_middleware()` on the endpoint, wrapping is done by
  calling `.wrap()` on the endpoint result, and getting a raw response can be
  gotten from calling `.raw()` on the endpoint result.
- Breaking: Endpoint responses must now be thread safe (`Send + Sync`).
- Breaking: Requests and responses from endpoint executions now use a `Vec<u8>`
  as the backing type for holding the raw body data. This is a change from
  `bytes::Bytes`.
- The `log` functionality was replaced with `tracing` and tracing was added to
  many of the crate functions. The `tracing` crate has the `log` feature enabled
  to enable backwards compatibility.
- The `Endpoint` trait no longer forces deriving of `Serialize`.

### Fixed

- Due to a design bug, query parameters of type `Option<T>` would still
  serialize if the value was `None`. The redesign associated with this version
  has resolved this issue and query parameters now share the same behavior as
  body data.

## [0.4.4] - 2021-09-11

### Changed

- Makes rustls the default TLS handler for reqwest

## [0.4.3] - 2021-09-01

### Changed

- Changes generic errors to anyhow errors to make them thread safe and more
  feature rich

## [0.4.2] - 2021-08-30

### Added

- Additional HTTP request methods

## [0.4.1] - 2021-08-26

### Added

### Changed

- Blocking clients have been moved to `rustify::blocking` and are disabled by
  default
- All `Endpoint` execution methods are now `async` by default
- Removes internal implementation of `Request` and `Response` and instead opts
  for using `http::Request` and `http::Response`
- Large amounts of internal refactoring to reduce repeated code and create
  smaller function footprints
- The `MiddleWare` and `Wrapper` implementations are now behind a feature flag
  and disabled by default

### Removed

  of an `Endpoint`

## [0.3.1] - 2021-08-21

### Added

### Changed

- Moves helper functions of out `Endpoint` scope
- Substitutes `()` for `EmptyEndpointResponse`
- Removes `strip` option and prefers using middleware
- Renames `Endpoint::execute()` to `Endpoint::exec()`

### Removed

- Support for middleware in `ReqwestClient`

## [0.2.0] - 2021-08-18

### Added

### Changed

- Successful response codes updated to an inclusive range of 200-208

### Fixed

- The `builder` option can now be used with structs that have generics and lifetimes
